# Development Guidelines

## Core Principles

### 1. Thoroughness & Accuracy
- **Always use the correct data sources** - Don't assume or use wrong data paths
- **Verify data accuracy** - Cross-check API responses and data flow
- **Be thorough in analysis** - Don't rush through implementations
- **Test thoroughly** - Always verify changes work end-to-end

### 2. Data-Driven Approach
- **Use specific metrics** - Provide concrete numbers, percentages, scores
- **Avoid generic text** - Replace vague statements with actionable insights
- **Base decisions on data** - Use actual analysis results, not assumptions
- **Show data sources** - Reference where insights come from

### 3. User Experience Focus
- **Sync changes to UI** - Ensure backend changes reflect in frontend
- **Test UI functionality** - Verify UI loads and displays correctly
- **Provide actionable insights** - Give specific buy/sell/hold recommendations
- **Maintain consistency** - Keep data consistent across all components

### 4. Code Quality
- **Handle errors gracefully** - Implement proper error handling and fallbacks
- **Use existing patterns** - Follow established code patterns in the project
- **Avoid breaking changes** - Ensure changes don't break existing functionality
- **Clean up after changes** - Remove unused code and fix linting errors

### 5. Communication
- **Listen carefully** - Pay attention to specific requirements
- **Ask clarifying questions** - Don't assume requirements
- **Provide clear explanations** - Explain what was changed and why
- **Be responsive to feedback** - Address issues promptly and thoroughly

## Common Instructions

### Data Accuracy
- Always verify data sources before using them

- Don't use placeholder or generic data

### UI Synchronization
- Always test that backend changes reflect in the UI
- Verify API responses contain the expected data
- Check for JavaScript errors or frontend issues
- Ensure responsive design works correctly

### Analysis Quality
- Provide specific, actionable insights
- Use concrete metrics and percentages
- Base recommendations on actual data analysis
- Avoid generic investment advice

### Testing & Verification
- Test API endpoints after changes
- Verify frontend loads without errors
